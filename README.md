# AutoTreeAI: LLM-Based Framework for Automotive Cyber Threat Modeling
This project demonstrates a complete workflow for **automotive cybersecurity threat modeling** using a combination of:

-  A curated dataset of **50 attack surface prompts** (`ATT2.json`)
-  An **LLM (OpenAI GPT)** for generating structured **Mermaid.js attack trees**
- An **interactive UI built with Gradio**
-  **MongoDB** for storing threat trees and prompts
-  **Render** deployment for easy public access

---

##  Overview

This project automates the creation of **automotive attack trees** from natural-language threat descriptions.  
It leverages LLMs to expand high-level threats into detailed, hierarchical structures that follow cybersecurity standards — helping analysts quickly visualize and explore potential attack surfaces.

## 🧩 Project Structure

| File/Folder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `ATT2.json` | 50 curated threat prompts related to automotive systems |
| `Threat_modelling_6thsem.ipynb` | Jupyter notebook for uploading prompts to MongoDB, testing LLM responses, and visualizing attack trees |
| `app.py` | Main Gradio web app (serves the interactive UI) |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies for local or cloud deployment |
| `.env` | Contains API keys (excluded from GitHub for security) |
| `README.md` | This file — project documentation |

## Features

- **Attack Tree Generation** — Enter or select a threat to automatically generate a hierarchical attack tree using GPT.
- **Database Integration** — Save and retrieve trees from MongoDB for future reference.
- **Data Export** — Export trees to CSV or JSON for documentation and reporting.
- **Custom Threat Modeling** — Add your own prompts to expand the attack database.
- **Visualization** — View generated trees in a clean, interactive Gradio interface.
