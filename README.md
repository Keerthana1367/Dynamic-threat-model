# 🔐 Automotive Threat Modeling with LLM & MongoDB

This project demonstrates a complete workflow for **automotive cybersecurity threat modeling** using a combination of:

- 📚 A curated dataset of **50 attack surface prompts** (`ATT2.json`)
- 🤖 An LLM (OpenAI GPT) for generating structured **Mermaid.js attack trees**
- 🧠 Interactive UI built with **Gradio**
- 🛢️ Threat trees and prompts stored in **MongoDB**
- 🌐 Deployed website via **Render**
